### VBA-Challenge - Analyzing Stock Market Data.

I used a VBA script to analyze stock market data across multiple quarters in this assignment. The script loops through each worksheet and retrieves the stock data while calculating **Quarterly Change**, **Percent Change**, and **Total Stock Volume**. Additionally, it identifies the stock with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total stock volume for each quarter.

## Results
- The script processes the stock data for each quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4).
- Screenshots for each Quarter were given in the VBA-Challenge repository.
- VBA-Challenge-Code.vba lists the codes used to run full stock analysis.

## Skills learned. 
- declaring variables
- looping
- If/Else statements
- nested loops and Ifs
- formatting cells
-conditional formatting

## Resources Used.
- The VBA programming syntax and logic for this challenge were based on Microsoft's VBA documentation:
  - [Microsoft VBA Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/library-reference/concepts/getting-started-with-vba-in-office)
- Conditional formatting logic and concepts were adapted from the following resource:
  - [Excel Conditional Formatting](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-conditional-formatting-to-highlight-information-ef9c0b4c-3a69-4d5d-9ad1-7e453915b168)
- Xpert Learning Assistant- Boot Camp Spot. 

## Conclusion:
- This challenge shows how powerful VBA can be in automating complex stock market analysis within Excel. By looping through multiple sheets of data, the script efficiently calculates key performance metrics. The use of conditional formatting makes it easy to visually identify trends, while the calculations for the greatest percentage increase, decrease, and total volume can provide insights for decision-making.
